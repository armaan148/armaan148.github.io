    <h1>What are the 4 types of Innovation?</h1>
 <h2>1. Incremental innovation</h2>
    <p>Incremental innovation, also known as continuous improvement, refers to improving a product or service that already exists. It is less ‘spectacular’ and disruptive than other types of innovation, but incremental innovation is effective when addressing transformation issues within the company.</p>
    <p>Moreover, incremental innovation is especially powerful thanks to its collaborative and collective nature. Value-creating ideas often come from client-facing employees, those who talk with customers daily. In addition, successful human resource development leaders have made it an asset in building a collective culture of improvement. In this article, we dive deeper into the best ways to create such a culture.</p>
    <p>The iPhone is a good example of incremental innovation, going from the iPhone 14 to the 15 and beyond.</p>
    <p>To unleash the value of incremental innovation, you must have an idea management solution in place. Our platform helps corporates engage talent, collect and assess ideas in a central hub, and integrate with systems through API. Learn more about how idea management platforms work here.</p>
  <h2>2. Adjacent innovation</h2>
    <p>Adjacent innovation is a typical example of a successful expansion. It refers to using existing capabilities (like technology or knowledge) to appeal to a new audience or enter a new market. This provides a competitive advantage to the original product or service that allows it to be differentiated in the market.</p>
    <p>Let’s illustrate the concept of adjacent innovation. Big companies want to integrate groundbreaking products and services into their portfolio. Rather than developing solutions themselves, they’ll look at their startup ecosystems. They will use startup scouting programs to identify existing technologies, buy them, and integrate them into their portfolio.</p>
 <h2>3. Disruptive innovation</h2>
    <p>Disruptive innovation refers to the actions taken by a smaller company to shake up an industry by targeting its large, existing competitors’ overlooked segments.</p>
    <p>Over time, the disruptive innovation party will accelerate and start taking over the main segments of the industry. When the adoption of the new innovation by the main segment happens, we speak of disruptive innovation.</p>
    <p>Netflix is a very good example of disruptive innovation. The company started by targeting a less essential segment of Blockbuster’s audience with its relatively unpopular offer of mailing rental DVDs. They then moved on to improve its services while keeping a low price, which appealed to and conquered Blockbuster’s main audience completely.</p>
 <h2>4.Radical innovation</h2>
    <p>Radical innovation is the “one more thing” of our article. And for good reason, it is the creation of a brand new product or service that nobody expected and that tends to impose itself on the life of users. Television and the smartphone are two typical examples of radical innovations that have changed our daily lives. </p>
    <p>Not all the results of an innovation are easily measurable. The method proposed in the Oslo manual from OECD consists of distinguishing the result of innovative activities from the resources invested to carry them out.</p>
    <p>It is no longer surprising that, in large companies, the results of an innovation are assessed in terms of accounting and financial indicators. It’s measured in profit, revenue growth, changes in share value, market capitalization, or productivity. </p>
    <p>Interested in trying out radical innovation? Consider the importance of two things. You need to thoroughly understand, or even anticipate, the market. Secondly, you must be able to develop advanced solutions rapidly. The answers to both can be found in external communities. Agorize has seen many global clients co-create solutions based on customer insights with innovation programs. Whether in IT, HR, Marketing, or CSR, you can build the innovation program that fits your needs.</p>
